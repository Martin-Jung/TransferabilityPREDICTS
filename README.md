Title:
The transferability and predictability of species-energy relationships at local scales

# TransferabilityPREDICTS
Testing whether local biodiversity estimates can be robustly predicted among similar studies

Idea:
Can we use the response between photosynthetic activity and species richness / abundance to predict them across scales. Idea is to apply cross-validation on PREDICTS data within and between studies. Different cross-validation schemes are used to evaluate predictability and transferability.
