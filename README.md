Title:
The transferability and predictability of species-energy relationships at local scales

# TransferabilityPREDICTS
Testing wether local biodiversity estimates can be robustly predicted among similar studies

Idea:
Can we use the response between photosynthetic activity and species richness / abundance to predict them across cales
Split all PREDICTS data into halfs and predict on half with the other
Split within and between pairs of combinations ( taxonomy / sampling methodology / scale / biome )

Are responses transferabile and predictable ?
- Assess R2 overall and for LOO / crossvalidated
- Identify what drives (or not) high correlations
- Map error sources

To do:
- Categorize PREDICTS studies properly based on taxonomy / sampling methodology / scale / biome
- Discover ways how to correct for varying sampling effort (Occupancy modelling)
- Think about model structure (Bayesian hierachical models)
